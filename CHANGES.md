0.25 Alpha 22-05-13 [Currently no MAC dynlib built for this, sorry - incoming soon I hope]
===================
- Now take into account the mouse inversion setting when using mouse pitch input.
- Ctrl , or . decreases or increases the FOV scale factor. 
- Ctrl-Alt , or . decreases or increases the size of the black distortion
border. This can be used to improve rendering speed with large border sizes (at
a cost to FOV), or *potentially* give more peripheral vision at smaller border
sizes.
- Ctrl V cycles through head track sensitivity multipliers. Try this at your own risk!

resource hog! Use Ctrl-B to toggle on/off. Use Ctrl-Alt B to cycle through FSAA
scale factors.
